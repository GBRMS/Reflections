How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It helped by higlighting all changes, and then shown ones that may have been done either unintentionally or forgotten about.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros - flexible, clearer, can make it work for your own situation, not too many commits.
Cons - might miss something, error prone, what happens if computer crashes lose changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Saving multiple files in one commit makes sense as there are many interralted files for one change.
For items such a spreadsheets and word documents then the changes are largely in one document.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Git log shows a history of the commits and the id with the commit comments.
Get diff shows in detail changes between the different commit points.
Also used git diff --shortstat to get stats on line changes.


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
You know you can always go back if there is a problem. Even if you check in. Also its possible
for other people to check and debug it.
